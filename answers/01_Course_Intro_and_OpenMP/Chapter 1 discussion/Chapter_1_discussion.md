# Discussion of Two Topics from the Book "A Tour of Computer Systems"

## Topic 1: The GNU Project

I find it particularly interesting, that the GNU Project tried to create its own operating system.
I always thought the project was about the spread of the idea of open source in the development of new software.
But the idea of a whole UNIX based operating system, with the idea of being able to do with it whatever the project 
wants sounds very cool! As an example Microsoft had to implement a functionality to fulfill the 
'Security Technical Implementation Guides' which was forced on Microsoft by the Pentagon in order for Windows to be 
allowed in classified Networks. 

It seems like the original developers of GNU were all about the freedom of someone to speak freely and being anonymous.
I really do wonder why they were never able to create their own kernel. Linux on the other hand profits alot from the
tools given by GNU. With it the first foundation for Open-Source was implemented.

## Topic 2: Cache/Storage Hierarchy

Another Topic that was interesting to me is the storage Pyramid (Figure 1.9). 
Even though I already knew about the concept of the pyramid, it is interesting to see, that the different levels uses 
cache lines from the levels below, which makes perfect sense.

It is crazy to think about the first pc's only had some kilobytes of memory an nowaydays a system with 32gb is
becoming normal. The progress of the technical evolution not only made memory bigger but also cache gets signifficalty 
larger with each iteration of a new System. 

An Example for this would be the first introduction of L3 Cache in a consumer CPU was 2003 with the 
Intel Pentium 4 Extreme Edition which only had 2 MB of L3 Cache. Modern 'Gaming' CPUs like the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D
have a stacked cache on the CPU-Die and by this achieve 96 MB L3 Cache on an 8 Core CPU.
